# Release Notes: Migration from v2.x.x to v3.0.0

- Version: 3.0.0
- Type: Major Release (Breaking Changes in the GraphAPI)
- [Details · Download](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

## Who Is Affected?

This release introduces a breaking change in the GraphAPI.  
If you are using OpenCloud only through official clients (Web, Desktop, or Mobile), no migration is needed.

If you're using any other software that utilizes the GraphAPI, that software might need to be adjusted to follow the new behavior of the GraphAPI.

## Key Changes

The following endpoints of the GraphAPI were changed in a way that is not backwards compatible with the previous releases:

```http
GET /v1.0/me/drives/
GET /v1.0/drives/
GET /v1beta1/drives/
GET /v1beta1/me/drives/
```

:::note
Due to performance optimizations, these endpoints no longer automatically expand all permissions on the drives root items. If needed, the permissions can be explicitly requested via the appropriate $expand query option.
